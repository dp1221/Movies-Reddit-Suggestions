# Movies-Reddit-Suggestions
Movie recommendations are a relevant topic for many digital consumers. However, despite the advanced algorithms used in Google, sometimes individuals turn to discussion forums for suggestions. This experiment creates a crude program of querying the Reddit discussion forum for similar movies, then using Spacy to parse through the results to compare its effectiveness qualitatively to Google results. This produced an output requiring further filtration. Proving generally effective, this underscores the potency of this methodâ€™s application in other less incentivized domains. Future developement encouraged!
